# Introduction

## Political change

<br>

<br>

## Punctuated equilibrium

<br>

![](punctuated_equilibrium2.png){fig-align="center"}

<br>



## What critical events/junctures?

<br>


![](person_question.png){fig-align="center"}

## Critical junctures for political change

<br>

***Indirect***

- **Economic** shocks

- **Socio-demographic** shocks

***Direct***

- Disruptive **party system** change

- [**Regime**]{style="color:red;"} change

---

<br>

The **impact of these junctures** have been analyzed mostly in the **short-term** and on **individual preferences and behaviour**

<br>


Lately, [**long-term**]{style="color:red;"} and [**cultural**]{style="color:red;"} outcomes with ***behavioral implications*** are gaining relevance


# Political Change and Ideological (de-)Stigmatization

## Political Stigmatization and Preference Falsification

[@valentim_political_2023]

. . .

<br>

Traditional models of political behaviour are mostly based on [*intrinsic motivations*]{style="color:red;"}


![](question_mark.png){fig-align="center"}

## Political stigmatization

<br>

**Stigmatization** is proposed as an instance of [*extrinsinc motivations*]{style="color:red;"} modelling political behaviour

. . .

<br>


***Definition***

A situation in which individuals perceive that there is a [social norm]{style="color:red;"} against a given *political preference*


## The argument

<br>


Showing a ***stigmatized political preference*** can come at the cost of [social sanction]{style="color:red;"}. If the **costs of the sanction** are high enough, they may outweigh the **utility** that individuals derive from **expressing their sincere views**, leading to [preference falsification]{style="color:red;"} [@kuran1987preference; @kuran1998private]

## The Spanish case

. . .

Stigmatization of [***Partido Popular (PP)***]{style="color:blue;"}, formerly **AP**, for being a **succesor party**

## The empirical strategy


. . .

<br>

Leveraging one case where the **electoral system** differs, creating *exogenous variation* in the **visibility of the vote choice**


<br>

The *assumption* here is that **increasing the public visibility of the vote choice will decrease the likelihood of voting for PP** only because of the probability of a [sanction]{style="color:red;"} due to a [stigmatized preference]{style="color:red;"}

## Social norm change and expression of stigmatized preferences

[@dinas_social_2023]

<br>

. . .

Increased in [nationalism]{style="color:red;"}  typically explained as an outcome of **out-group threat**


![](question_mark.png){fig-align="center"}


## Out-group threat triggering norm erosion

<br>

**First-movers** break the [social norm]{style="color:red;"} which ***signals*** its weakening, thus further **eroding** it [(lower sanctioning costs)]{style="color:grey;"}

. . .

1. Increase of **public** expressions of nationalism

2. Stable **private** expressions of nationalism

3. How does **coordination** work?

## The Spanish case (II)

. . .

**Regime change** does not only bring the [stigmatization]{style="color:red;"} of political parties or ideologies [@dinas2020ideological], but it stigmatized the expression of [nationalism]{style="color:red;"} itself in Spain

## The Catalan conflict in 2017

<br>

![](fig1_flags.png){fig-align="center"}

<center>Dinas et al [-@dinas_social_2023]</center>

## Empirical strategy

<br>

1. *Establishing* the **increase of flags** after **1-O**

. . .

2. Identifying *relationship* **flags' exposure** and **public** [(not private)]{style="color:grey;"} **expressions of nationalism**

. . .

3. Proving **flags' display** as a [**coordination mechanism**]{style="color:red;"}

## Results I - Flags' increase

## Results II - Flags' increase

> "The first people that raised the national flag, broke with the social norm and influenced other people to do the same. In my opinion, **it wasn’t necessarily the change of social norms that came first**. Rather, it was people's change in behavior that resulted in a rupture of social norms" (Sara)

---

> "...in **2018 the World Cup** took place and even tough Spain didn’t come very far that year, it would have been interesting to see if it had an impact on flag display until July 2018. Especially because Dinas et al valued francoist flags as national flags (p.11 N3) and soccer fans probably wouldn’t hang the francoist flag" (Sara)


. . .

> "If the **population of Madrid** as a whole were **more right-wing** oriented, the social repercussions for openly expressing nationalist sentiments wouldn't be very harsh, and therefore less of a hindering factor." (Sara)

--- 

> “Do you think it is appropriate to have a national flag on the balcony? (Yes, no)”

> "I think this question doesn’t leave enough space for context. Because while **someone might find it inappropriate to raise the national flag on a daily basis** due to nationalist reasons, they might think it’s ok to do so during a national sports tournament (World Cup) or for a national Holiday." (Sara)
