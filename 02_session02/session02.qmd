# What is culture?

## The sociological approach

-   The scientific study of [meaning]{style="color:red;"} (i.e., **"the mean of meaning"**)

-   Building upon anthropology and ethnographic studies

-   Traditionally, interpretativist/**constructivist approach**:

    -   There can be no measurement of culture without interpretation

    -   Problems of measuring culture: *subjective* vs *objective* reality

-   Related to the **cultural studies** field

## The sociological approach

-   More recently, realist blend and openness to cross-methodological approaches:

> "Rather than seeking to compel the field to converge around a set of standardized measures, this book instead advocates for an iterative approach that embraces diverse measurement strategies and specifies the research questions to which each strategy is most usefully applied." [@Mohr2020]

## The sociological approach

-   Different elements of culture studied separately:

    1.  **People**

    2.  **Objects**

    3.  **Relationships** (e.g., social networks)

## When is culture relevant?

-   Culture only has [causal force]{style="color:red;"} when it generates a set of **norms** to enforce it [@dandrade_kinds_2008] [(*more on session 3*)]{style="color:grey;"}

**Culture is too broad**: it says too much and too little as to be analytically useful

<br>

...instead, **specific forms** to be studied

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<center>Cohen et al [-@cohen1996insult]</center>

## The biological approach

-   Culture as a **cumulative endeavour**

-   The role of our larger brain, extended childhood and before death life: space to store, time to learn and time to teach

-   Natural selection favouring better [**cultural learners**]{style="color:red;"}

-   The generation of social norms ad a process of **self-domestication**: prosocial, dociles, etc

-   Innovation depends more on **sociability** than in our intellect

## The biological approach

-   **Culture-gene co-evolution**

    -   The cultures that adapt better are those that survive

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](fig2_cohen96.png){fig-align="center"}

<center>Cohen et al [-@cohen1996insult]</center>

## The biological approach

-   **Culture-gene co-evolution**

    -   The cultures that adapt better are those that survive

    -   [Selective and preferential learning]{style="color:red;"} following cues: prestige (different from dominance), success, skills, sex and ethnicity

. . .

**What are the political and sociological implications of cues?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Our definition of culture

> "... the large body of practices, techniques, heuristics, tools, motivations, values, and beliefs that we all acquire while growing up, mostly by learning from other people." [@Henrich2015]

## The biological approach

-   Cultural manifestations:

    -   Tastes

    -   Motivations

    -   Beliefs

    -   Strategies and standards for punishment and reward

-   **What are each of the components above?**

-   **How are they normally treated** in traditional social sciences approaches? [(e.g., preferences in economics)]{style="color:grey;"}

## The biological approach summarized

> We don't have tools because we are smart, but we are smart because thanks to culture, we have these tools [@Henrich2015]

. . .

-   Individual vs [social learning]{style="color:red;"}

    -   Cultural learning as a form of social learning [(i.e., watching others)]{style="color:grey;"}

## The approach from economics

<br>

**Rational Choice Theory (RCT):**

-   People make (optimal) decisions, given preferences, beliefs and constraints.

-   If people behave differently in different societies, that is due to differences in one of these three factors.

## The approach from economics

<br>

**Relaxing RCT:**

-   [Rules-of-thump]{style="color:red;"} can be rational if choices are too cognitively demanding and/or too noisy [@boyd1987evolution]

-   Preferences not fixed [(e.g., others, the environment)]{style="color:grey;"}

## Can culture be rational?

<br>

![](person_question.png){fig-align="center"}

## The approach from economics

Two equilibria, both *Pareto* Optimal

![](battle_sexes.png){fig-align="center"}

Which one will prevail?

. . .

***Culture can explain why in some societies or contexts some equilibria are more likely than others***

## Modern approaches to culture

The emerging field of **Historical Political Economy (HPE)** [*(more on session 4)*]{style="color:grey;"}

. . .

- It combines **economic reasoning** and **econometrics** with **historical data** and **theories of path dependency and historical legacies**

> Looking at history to understand today, **systematically** and using **modern empirical tools**

## Modern approaches to culture
    
- **Promises**:

    1. **New methods**: causal inference designs, spatial analysis, quantitative text analysis, machine/deep learning
    2. **More data than ever!** Longitudinal, events, geo-coded, network-based, etc.

. . .

- **Challenges**:

    1.  Data can be overwhelming and mostly untidy (i.e., costly)
    2.  Difficulties to connect data and theory (i.e., validity issues)

# Conclusion

## How can we operationalize culture?

. . .

- **Preferences**: dispositions to act in a particular way in a specific situation.

- **Beliefs**: probabilities assigned on others' actions or state of affairs.

- **Heuristics**: rules of thumb for decision-making.

- **Moral norms**: patterns of behavior sustained by beliefs about what is the correct thing to do.

- **Social norms**: patterns of behavior sustained by beliefs about what other think is the correct think to do. 

## What is culture?

. . .

<br>

All of these elements together! 

<br>

. . .

**Preferences, social norms, beliefs and heuristics** common to a [**group**]{style="color:red;"} and transmitted through **social learning**. 

<br>

. . .

**Adapted to the environment**, but that does not mean all cultural traits are always adaptive. **They can be also sticky** [*(more on session 4)*]{style="color:grey;"}.
