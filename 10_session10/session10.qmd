# Cultural Change and Backlash

## Feminist Social Movements on Countering Violence Against Women

[@gandara-guerra_we_2023]

. . .

<br>

What explains **sanctioning** of [gender-based violence]{style="color:red;"} [(sexism)]{style="color:grey;"}?

. . .

1. **#MeToo** movement

2. **Nirbhaya's case** in India

. . .

...but what is the ***general argument***?

## The argument

. . .

<br>

[Public demonstrations]{style="color:red;"} of **gender-based violence's** ***rejection*** should increase [reporting of gender crimes]{style="color:red;"} through three distinct **mechanisms**:

1. Increased [*empowerment*]{style="color:blue;"}

2. Increased [*in-group identification*]{style="color:blue;"}

3. [*Social norm*]{style="color:blue;"} change

## The 8-M protests in Spain

![](manada.png){fig-align="center"}

![](8m.png){fig-align="center"}

<center>Madrid, March 8th 2019</center>

## Empirical strategy

. . .

[***Aggregate level***]{style="color:red;"}

- Municipalities with/without **8M rallies**

- Judicial districts' **gender violence reports**


[***Individual level***]{style="color:red;"}

- Survey data about **feminism** and gender violence in 2014 and 2019

- Pooled surveys from 2014 to 2019 about **self-identification**

## Results I - Individual level

## Results II - Individual level

![](tab2_nerea.png){fig-align="center"}

## Results III - Individual level

## Results IV - Aggregate level

## What are the implications of this study?


![](implications.png){fig-align="center"}

## And what about its limitations?

<br>

. . .

> "...the **definition of feminism** on which this article is based is unclear to me. It seems to be a definition that excludes men and is based on a binary gender concept." (Naemi)

. . .

> "Many **datasets** still adhere to a binary understanding of gender, which overlooks individuals who fall outside this narrow framework, thereby complicating quantitative research into their issues." (Naemi)

---

> "Future research could apply the methodology and arguments used in this article to **other marginalized groups** whose concerns are also proclaimed through protests." (Naemi)

. . .

> "I also wonder what the results would look like if the **urban-rural divide**, which appears to be pertinent to gender-related matters, had been controlled for." (Naemi)

. . .

> "why **certain cultures** have more violence against women than others are still not answered." (Saravana)

---

<br>

<br>

> "a confrontation with feminist protests leads to a strengthening of **feminist identification** for all women debatable" (Naemi)


## The Individual Dynamics of Gender Backlash

[@anduiza_sexism_2022]

. . .

<br>

Increasing **far-right voting** but virtually no connection with [**gender attitudes**]{style="color:red;"}

. . .

<br>

Attempt to ***disentangle*** both

## The argument

. . .

<br>

[Modern sexism]{style="color:red;"}

1. Denial of **women’s discrimination**

2. Rejection and delegitimization of any **complaint** involving women’s discrimination

3. Rejection of any **measures** taken to correct inequality and discrimination

## The argument

. . .

<br>

Three potential **links**:

1. [Predisposition]{style="color:red;"}

2. [Activation]{style="color:red;"}

3. [Change]{style="color:red;"}

    &#8594; **Normalization**

    &#8594; **Backlash**

## Empirical strategy

. . .


Panel data around the **8M protests** and [**VOX entry**]{style="color:red;"} in Spain

  - Four time points *between 2017 and 2020*

## What are the implications of this study?


![](implications.png){fig-align="center"}

## And what about its limitations?

<br>

. . .

> "The study wants to explain the rise of a far-right party but neither includes the group of **people above the age of 56** (which makes up around a fifth of the population of Spain), nor people without **internet access**." (Julien)

. . .

> "...the **actual vote choice** and the intended vote choice could still vary." (Julien)


---

<br>

> "The study focuses on **Spain** and the rise of the Vox party, which may limit the applicability of its findings to other countries or political contexts." (Jasna)

<br>

> "...it would have been interesting to make a comparison with a similarly radical right-wing party in another country with feminist demonstrations. This would increase the **generalizability** significantly." (Jasna)

---

<br>

> "(It would be interesting to do) research in another country or instead of analyzing party votes, focusing on support of **individual far-right politicians** with sexist views." (Julien) 

. . .

<br>

> "...future research could examine, how the relationship is affected by factors like **media**’s influence, which is an important variable in these times" (Jasna)

---

<br>

<br>

> "...it would have been interesting to read a discussion from the authors about how the dynamic political landscape and **possible future shifts** may alter the relationship between gender attitudes and far-right voting." (Jasna)
