## Politics and culture

-   What do you understand by **politics**?

-   What do you understand by **political behaviour**?

. . .

-   What do you understand by [**culture**]{style="color:red;"}?

## Why culture?

-   Traditional approaches to political behaviour have focused on:

    1.  Institutions

    2.  Socio-demographic factors

    3.  Psychological factors

. . .

-   **Cultural factors**, despite acknowledgedly pervasive, has been largely ignored in political science until recently

## The stronger presence of culture in political science

-   Main reasons:

    1.  New **methods** (i.e., identification revolution)

    2.  More **data** (i.e., digitalization of large corpora of text)

    1.  New **methods** (i.e., identification revolution)

    2.  More **data** (i.e., digitalization of large corpora of text)

    3.  **Historical turn** of empirical social science (i.e., why bad arrangements "stick"?)

    3.  **Historical turn** of empirical social science (i.e., why bad arrangements "stick"?)

    4.  **External validity** concerns (i.e., replication crisis)

## The WEIRD realization

<br>

. . .

***Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD)*** societies

-   Replication crisis in psychology and the social sciences unveiled

-   Influential paper: Henrich et al [-@henrich_weirdest_2010]

## Summary

-   Culture as an **overlooked dimension to unpack**

-   Culture remained to be **(1) conceptualized, (2) operationalized and (3) theorized within political science**

## Teaching policy

-   This course is designed as a ***seminar***, **not a lecture!**

-   Thus, I expect you to have read the **mandatory readings** and to **participate**

-   Ideally, I will introduce the topic and guide the discussion, but you should actively pursue the debate

. . .

-   The main drivers of the debate will be the readings, but we can (will) deviate from them, the goal is to develop **critical thinking**!

## Integration and interaction policy
