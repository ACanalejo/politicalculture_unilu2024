# Introduction

---

<br>

***Last session...***

The impact of **critical events** [(juncture)]{style="color:grey;"} on political culture

. . .

<br>

***This session...***

Can **moderate change** [(policy/institutional change)]{style="color:grey;"} impact [political culture]{style="color:red;"} too?

# Institutions and Cultural Change

## Can Policy Change Culture?

[@bau2021can]

. . .

<br>

Three traditional [kinship]{style="color:red;"} models

1. Matrilocal/matrilineal

2. Patrilocal/patrilineal

3. Neolocal


## The argument

. . .

<br>

**Matrilocal (patrilocal)** practices serve to ensure that the **daughter (son)** which child will [take care of the parents]{style="color:red;"} when they become old

<br>

This culture has implications for [selective investment]{style="color:red;"} in **imperfectly altruistic** settings

## The argument

. . .

<br>

The introduction of [pension plans]{style="color:red;"} as a feature of **modernization** should remove the need for this investment, thus ***eliminating matrilocal/patrilocal practices***

<br>

Therefore, a relatively small policy can have huge [cultural implications]{style="color:red;"}

## Empirical strategy

. . .

<br>

Matching local **ethnicity census** data with **ethnic practices** data [(*Ethnographic Atlas* & *Ethnologue*)]{style="color:grey;"}

<br>

Two [cases]{style="color:red;"}:

1. **Indonesia** (matrilocal vs neolocal)

2. **Ghana** (patrilocal vs neolocal)

<center>Bau [-@bau2021can]</center>

## Empirical strategy

<br>

Coding [modern days]{style="color:red;"} **matrilocal (patrilocal)**  practices with census data

---

![](tab1_policy.png){fig-align="center"}

<center>Bau [-@bau2021can]</center>


## Empirical strategy

<br>

Coding [modern days]{style="color:grey;"} **matrilocal (patrilocal)**  practices with census data

<br>

Controlling for [historical confounders]{style="color:red;"}:

1. Early hunter gatherer societies

2. Horticultural societies vs. plow/cattle

3. Dowry and bride price

## Results I - Gender gap in education (Indonesia)

## The Effect of a Supreme Court Decision on Social Norms

[@tankard2017effect]

. . .

<br>

***Traditional research question***

Do **institutional decisions** influence people's [attitudes]{style="color:red;"}?

. . .

<br>

***This paper's research question***

Do [**institutional decisions**]{style="color:grey;"} influence perceptions of [social norms]{style="color:red;"}?

---

<br>

**Social norms** &#8800; **personal attitudes**

<br>

Both are argued to have independent [behavioral influence]{style="color:red;"}

<br>

However, the **influence of institutional decisions on behavior via social norms** have not been tested 

## The argument

. . .

<br>

The [link]{style="color:red;"} between **institutional decisions** and **attitudes** is not clear [(ideology, experience)]{style="color:grey;"}. However, [**institutional decisions**]{style="color:grey;"} may influence **social norms** because:

1. They may signal [group opinion]{style="color:red;"} [(representation of a collective)]{style="color:grey;"}

2. They serve as an [expert projection]{style="color:red;"} of the direction in which public opinion will move

3. [Simultaneous observation]{style="color:red;"}  of the same decision

## Obergefell v. Hodges 2015

. . .

<br>

US Supreme Court's ruling allowing **same sex marriage**

<br>

***Expectations***

1. It will increase [perceived public support]{style="color:red;"} toward same sex marriage

2. It will not increase *private personal support*

## Empirical strategy

. . .

<br>

***Study 1***

[Experiment]{style="color:red;"} *before* the Supreme Court ruling manipulating the **perceived likelihood** that the Court ruling will be **positive or negative**

<br>

***Study 2***

[Panel survey]{style="color:red;"} *around the time* of the Supreme Court decision

## Results I - Study 1

> "It would be beneficial for future research to explore similar instances in **different cultural or political contexts** to ascertain the universal applicability of these findings. For example, here in Switzerland you might find a more balanced approach, with a political system including a more fragmented party constellation." (Luca)

---


> "Would similar shifts in perceived norms be observable in response to Supreme Court decisions on **less polarized issues**, or in decisions made by **less authoritative** bodies?" (Luca)

. . .

> "Following the **Supreme Court’s 2022 reversal of Roe v Wade**, one study reported that perceived social norms jumped in favour of legalised abortion, sending Democrat trust in the court plummeting to its lowest level since records began. When exactly does deference become defiance and why?" (Amanda)

---

> "Is it determined by the degree of political polarisation on the issue, the number of people affected, restrictions of personal freedom, or even how it is spun by the **media**? " (Amanda)


> "How do different types of **media** coverage influence the relationship between institutional decisions and public opinion?" (Luca)

. . .

> "Over what time frame and under what conditions might institutional decisions begin to affect **personal attitudes**?" (Luca)


---

> "...opening with a fictitious endorsement of gay marriage from the Supreme Court sends a clear message on the **researchers’ ideology** on a politically sensitive topic. This could encourage not the real answers but the “right” ones" (Amanda)

. . .

> "Experimenting with different frames, wordings or stated research intentions compared to none at all could allow the researchers to gauge just how far subjects would go to please them." (Amanda)
